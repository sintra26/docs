# Contacts

The **Contacts** feature allows you to store and manage individual people across nearly all entities in the system, within **Insureds**, **Claim Submissions**, **Policies**, and **Events**. Each contact record contains key communication details like nase, title, email, phone number, address, and a description. Contacts are stored within a table that can be sorted by any of the aforementioned details for ease of access, and can be added or updated on a per-entity basis.
